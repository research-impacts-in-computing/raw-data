# Research Impact in Computing Initiative

This organization was founded in the wake of the ShutdownSTEM movement, in response to systemic and recurring police brutality against black citizens in the United States, and further brutality against protesters demanding government action.

This brutality is enabled, in part, by the military technologies that we computing researchers aid in researching and developing, and funded by the massive budgets given to US military and police, which are justified, in part, by their use to fund our research.

As researchers, it is our duty to not only advance the state of knowledge, but to ask how our work impacts the state of the world.

While some facts are obvious---state-sponsored violence is wide-spread and disproportionality affects black people, computing technology we develop supports this violence, and the funding we accept ties us to this violence---what action individual researchers or research institutions should take it not.

We seek to transparently document the wider impact of our work, with particular attention to how it relates to military and police violence, and to make recommendations for those who wish to shift their own impacts into alignment with their ethics.

<!-- This is true, but a distraction in a mission statement.
As this organization was founded in response to a US situation, and organized by a heavily US-based group of researchers, we focus on those we know best—US institutions. We are open to broadening our scope—talk to us!

## Transparency in Funding
Research funding comes from a number of sources, and some of the largest and best know are governmental and military agencies. While it is easy to avoid directly applying with these agencies if you wish, unfortunately, the sources of funding are not always clear. Funds may sometimes be dispersed from one agency on behalf of another.

It is important that researchers know the source of their funding so they can make informed choices about which funding to pursue. We thus seek to maintain information about the sources of funds and the connections between various agencies.

## Transparency in Access
Funding is a political and economic transaction. Agencies do not provide funds for no reason; they are purchasing something, whether it is access to research, access to highly qualified people for recruiting purposes, or an improved reputation. This raises the natural question: why is this access so valued, particularly when we often pretend our research is available to all equally?

It is important for individuals and organizations to understand what they are selling in exchange for the funds they receive. We seek to maintain information on what funding agencies receive as direct and indirect benefits of the funds they disperse, so researchers can assess what impact their research makes merely by accepting funding.

It is also important for researchers to know how funding agencies may use or restrict the use of research technologies. We thus seek to maintain information about how transferred technologies are used by funding agencies, and what restrictions the agencies may place on research or technologies developed using their funds.

Funding agencies are not the only entities that control access to our work. The very system of publication we rely on often restricts access to our work. It is not always obvious how publication agencies may restrict access, or what the overall impact of that restriction may be. We aim to document how publication agencies restrict access, the affect of these restrictions, and alternatives that may exist.

## Transparency in Use and Impact
As researchers, we can fool ourselves into thinking our work is ethically and politically neutral. Yet some work may lend itself to certain political or ethically questionable aims by its very nature, and whether or not this is the case is not obvious. We aim to collect information about the downstream impacts of computing research, and to document how computing research is put to use in practice.

<!--probably shouldn't be in this mission statement but it's the shared document we have 

## Suggested First Actions:
- Mission statement, which we can use to publically recruit organizers.
- Collect a list of common funding agencies, their connection to uses of violence, and how specific technologies releted to the computing research community are used.

## Brain storming other actions:
- A simple rating system ("B" corporations) to help researchers navigate how closely a funding source is tied to violence
- A database of funding sources, particularly alternatives to governemtnal, military, or policing sources that are closely tied to vioalence, to help researchers navigate their search for funding
- Investigate the legal enforcability of restrictive licensing
- Recommendations:
  - E.g., is it effective to say "My lab will not accept funding from military"? What are alternative sources if you want to commit to that?
  - Is it effective/enforcable to license software for non-military purposes? Non-commercial seems like GPL does seem to get corporations to avoid some software, in some instances.
- Investigate how PL is used by these funding agencies. Why are they so interested in verification? Is my technology somehow harmful in ways I don't understand?
- How does closed access publishing affect the impact of our work?
